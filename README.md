## 🔧 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ecommerce-app.git
cd ecommerce-app
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Setup Firebase

Create `src/firebase-config.js`:

```js
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getAuth } from "firebase/auth";
import { getFirestore } from "firebase/firestore";
import { getStorage } from "firebase/storage";

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);

export const auth = getAuth(app);
export const db = getFirestore(app);
export const storage = getStorage(app);
```

## 🔒 Role-Based Access

Users are assigned roles (admin/user) via Firestore in a `users` collection. Admin routes are protected using role checks in React Router.

npm run dev
```
